## Notes

A lot of the main work was interesting to tackle. Overall, a really useful learning experience for interacting
with multiple activities in an app and transferring data between. I also did enjoy the storing of information
locally in order to preserve the data beyond the current user session use.
I definitely wish to work on similar projects in the future!
